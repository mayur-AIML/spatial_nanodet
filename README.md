# Efficient Real-time Pedestrian Detection and Social Distancing Monitoring using UAVs with Spatial Attention Mechanism

This repository contains the implementation of our lightweight pedestrian detection network designed for real-time social distancing monitoring using UAVs. The model uses ShuffleNet_V2 as the backbone and integrates a Spatial Attention Mechanism to enhance detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency
